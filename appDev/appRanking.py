You can use helium to access websites. Don't bother about the helium driver, it's already managed.
We've already ran "from helium import *"
Then you can go to pages!
Code:
```py
go_to('github.com/trending')
```<end_code>

You can directly click clickable elements by inputting the text that appears on them.
Code:
```py
click("Top products")
```<end_code>

If it's a link:
Code:
```py
click(Link("Top products"))
```<end_code>

If you try to interact with an element and it's not found, you'll get a LookupError.
In general stop your action after each button click to see what happens on your screenshot.
Never try to login in a page.

To scroll up or down, use scroll_down or scroll_up with as an argument the number of pixels to scroll from.
Code:
```py
scroll_down(num_pixels=1200) # This will scroll one viewport down
```<end_code>

When you have pop-ups with a cross icon to close, don't try to click the close icon by finding its element or targeting an 'X' element (this most often fails).
Just use your built-in tool `close_popups` to close them:
Code:
```py
close_popups()
```<end_code>

You can use .exists() to check for the existence of an element. For example:
Code:
```py
if Text('Accept cookies?').exists():
    click('I accept')
```<end_code>
